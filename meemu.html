        <p class="centered">Meemu is a website targeted towards a wide audience, focusing on giving a place to find clean and top-tier memes to everyone, including the young.</p>
        <p class="centered">As i've explored the internet, two things became very apparent.</p>
        <div class="center-block">
            <p class="centered"><br>1. There's a low chance I can show some of this stuff to my siblings...</p>
            <p class="centered">2. In order to find the best, I had to trudge through the worst.<br></p>
        </div>
        <p class="centered">I hope that when this website is completed, it can give all a place to avoid the trudging, and find the gold!</p>
